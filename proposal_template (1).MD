
#### *Machine Learning in FinTech*:  
with your group suggest and research one Use case in Fintech, locate some data in this space, explore it a bit, and choose a model you'd like to work with.

**Area of FinTech**:  
Credit Card Fraud Detection.


**Dataset researched and located**:  
Data sources: Kaggle.com, dataset used: creditcard.csv


**ML Use Case**:  
The project aims at improving the existing fraud detection process of Worldline by adding a number of deep learning and adaptive functionalities to the existing data driven strategies.


**ML model selected**:  
Logistic Regression model, and Random Forest model.


**Reason**: 
 We choose Logistic Regression model because it's not only provides a measure of how appropriate a predictor(coefficient size)is, but also its direction of association (positive or negative). Also we choose Random Forest model because our data is big and it's handling it, and provide the highest accuracy.
